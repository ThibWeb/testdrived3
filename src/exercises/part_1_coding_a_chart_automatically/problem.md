Of course hard-coding is impractical for most datasets, and the point of this tutorial is to teach you how to create charts from data automatically. So now letâ€™s create the same structure using D3.

// TODO As on the previous exercise, select the .chart element.
// Then bind your numbers to the <div> to create the bars.
// Use the enter() selection to append a new div for each number
// Change their CSS width according to their value
// Set their text to be their value

starting with an empty page that contains only a div of class "chart". The following script selects the chart container and then appends a child div for each bar with the desired width:

## HINTS

Here is some boilerplate:

```js
module.exports = function(numbers) {
    // TODO As on the previous exercise, select the .chart element.
    // Then bind your numbers to the <div> to create the bars.
    // Use the enter() selection to append a new div for each number
    // Change their CSS width according to their value
    // Set their text to be their value
};
```
